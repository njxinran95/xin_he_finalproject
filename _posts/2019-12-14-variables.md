## Predicted variable: Larceny index
The Larceny Index for a block group would be equal to **total number of larceny incidents divided by total population in the block group and then times 100,000.**
From the histogram of actual larceny index as below, most block groups have larceny index less than 500,000, there are some over 1 million, the maximum even reaches to 6,000,000.


## Correlation of all explanatory variables
We wanted to check if thereâ€™s a distribution pattern of larceny incidents in each day or some days per week. So, we grouped the data and calculated the number of larceny incidents by day of week. Afterwards, we reordered the dataframe in the order from Monday to Sunday and used Matplotlib to produce a bar chart for the reordered data.

## By neighborhood
Summarized by neighborhoods, the first 4 neighborhoods most vulnerable to thefts are South of Market (70,100), Financial District/South Beach (58,197), Mission (41,448), and Tenderloin neighborhood (34,142). In fact, the number of SOMA is more than twice of Tenderloin! On its opposite, Lincoln Park, Presidio, Seacliff, and McLaren Park (The number of larcenies in these neighborhoods are smaller than 500!) are the 4 safest neighborhoods to larcenies in SF.

## Datashade: Density of larceny count
We got totally 480,448 larceny cases from the dataset and we visualized the preliminary view of the density of larceny incidents happened in San Francisco by using datashader package to aggregate the crime points and shade the aggregated pixels.

It is clear to notice that the northeastern part of the city (Chinatown, financial district and Tenderloin neighborhood) seems to have the highest density of larceny incidents in the past.

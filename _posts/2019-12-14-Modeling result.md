## For explanatory variables
We visualized the feature importance of the variables as below. According to the hvplot, we found that **percentage of vacant housing units and population density** in each block group are the two most important variables to improve our modelâ€™s fitness.

## Predicted larceny index
We plotted the predicted larceny indexes by block groups as below. IThe deeper the color, the higher the possibility the larcenies would happen. We found that the areas with high larceny indexes kept their high potential of larceny incidents in the prediction. Moreover, Presidio and Hunters Point areas seem to have high potential for the happening of larcenies as well even though not many larceny incidents happened in these two places in the past.

From the histogram of predicted larceny index as below, the predicted results are largely 500,000 with only a few over 1 million.
